Using the starter code file and the provided csv complete the following steps.
	Establish a Baseline Performance
	Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm
	Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier
	Create an Evaluation Report

1. Establish a Baseline Performance

	Import the OHLCV dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
	Generate trading signals using short- and long-window SMA values.

	Split the data into training and testing datasets.
	Use the SVC classifier model from SKLearn's support vector machine (SVM) learning method to fit the training data and make predictions based on the testing data. Review the predictions.
	Review the classification report associated with the SVC model predictions.
	Create a predictions DataFrame that contains columns for “Predicted” values, “Actual Returns”, and “Strategy Returns”.
	Run and save a PNG image of this plot. This will serve as a baseline against which to compare the effects of tuning the trading algorithm.
